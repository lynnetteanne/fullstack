        <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth 
            and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are 
            yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in 
            color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color 
            of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p>

            <!--images of a squirrel monkey-->
        <p>Most species are arboreal, using all four limbs to leap from tree to 
            tree. They can sit upright and stand erect. Most species run along 
            branches rather than swinging arm over arm like the apes. Monkeys are 
            highly social omnivores, organized in clans as large as several hundred 
            individuals headed by an old male.</p>

            <!--image of an alligator-->
        <p>Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at 
            the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is 
            underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have 
            dark stripes on the tail. It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a 
            crocodile by the teeth.</p>
